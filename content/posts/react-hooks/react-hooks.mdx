## Introduction

React hooks were released with React 16.8 and they were created to allow developers to access state, life cycle and other features without using class based components.


## useState

This hook returns a tuple the first parameter being the current state and the second a method, allowing you to change the current state of the hook.
The example below is a simple counter, you can see that the first parameter of use state us `count` which is equal to the current state as I mentioned earlier. 

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useEffect
